    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be combing the knowledge presented in a modern Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network topic (RHGNNs) with a customized collection of data. \n",
    "This will be achieved in hopes to show the applications of RHGNNs for downstream tasks like node classification and link prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this notebook will utilize the dataset provided by LastFM, called LastFM1b. With this collection of listening events \n",
    "we will create a heterogeneous graph that our machine learning model with utilize to create high-quality embeddings. \n",
    "Once this is finished we will utilize the embeddings to find patterns in user listening behavior\n"

    "the relational information that exists between nodes is utilized for imporving the noderepresentations. \n",
    "Each convolutional component of this model is able to learn node represenations of a singlar relational type. \n",
