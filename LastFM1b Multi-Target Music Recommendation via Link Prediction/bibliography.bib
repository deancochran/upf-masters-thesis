   abstract = {A large number of real-world graphs or networks are inherently heterogeneous , involving a diversity of node types and relation types. Heterogeneous graph embedding is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into low-dimensional node representations. Existing models usually define multiple meta-paths in a heterogeneous graph to capture the composite relations and guide neighbor selection. However, these models either omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes along the meta-path, or only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations , we propose a new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to boost the final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components, i.e., the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the inter-metapath aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, node clustering, and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines.},

   abstract = {Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain meaningful node representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics. Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately. Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process. Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.},

R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved by enriching them with an en-coder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the relational graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline.},

Recently, graph neural networks have become the new state-of-the-art approach of recommender systems. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph neural network-based recommender systems. We first introduce the background and the history of the development of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. For recommender systems, in general, there are four aspects for categorizing existing works: stage, scenario, objective, and application. For graph neural networks, the existing methods consist of two categories, spectral models and spatial ones. We then discuss the motivation of applying graph neural networks into recommender systems, mainly consisting of the high-order connectivity, the structural property of data, and the enhanced supervision signal. We then systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding propagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency. Afterward and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a multitude of existing works of graph neural network-based recommender systems, following the taxonomy above. Finally, we raise discussions on the open problems and promising future directions of this area.

Due to the important application value of recommender systems, there have always been emerging works in this field.

Recently, graph neural network (GNN) techniques have been widely utilized in recommender systems since most of the information in recommender systems essentially has graph structure and GNN has superiority in graph representation learning. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of GNN-based recommendation models according to the types of information used and recommendation tasks. Moreover, we systematically analyze the challenges of applying GNN on different types of data and discuss how existing works in this field address these challenges.

In this paper, we incorporate a repeat-explore mechanism into neural networks and propose a new model, called RepeatNet, with an encoder-decoder structure. RepeatNet integrates a regular neural recommendation approach in the decoder with a new repeat recommendation mechanism that can choose items from a user’s history and recommends them at the right time. We report on extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. RepeatNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on all three datasets in terms of MRR and Recall.

Link prediction is a fast-growing research area in both physics and computer science domain. There exists a wide range of link prediction techniques like similarity-based indices, probabilistic methods, dimensionality reduction approaches, etc., which are extensively explored in different groups of this article. Learning-based methods are covered in addition to clustering-based and information-theoretic models in a separate group. The experimental results of similarity and some other representative approaches are tabulated and discussed. To make it general, this review also covers link prediction in different types of networks, for example, directed, temporal, bipartite, and heterogeneous networks. Finally, we discuss several applications with some recent developments and concludes our work with some future works.}

abstract = {Diversification has become one of the leading topics of recommender system research not only as a way to solve the over-fitting problem but also an approach to increasing the quality of the user’s experience with the recommender system. This article aims to provide an overview of research done on this topic from one of the first mentions of diversity in 2001 until now. The articles ,and research, have been divided into three sub-topics for a better overview of the work done in the field of recommendation diversification: the definition and evaluation of diversity; the impact of diversification on the quality of recommendation results and the development of diversification algorithms themselves. In this way, the article aims both to offer a good overview to a researcher looking for the state-of-the-art on this topic and to help a new developer get familiar with the topic.}

abstract = {Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has become the new state-of-the-art approach in many recommendation problems, with its strong ability to handle structured data and to explore high-order information. However, as the recommendation tasks are diverse and various in the real world, it is quite challenging to design proper GNN methods for specific problems. In this tutorial, we focus on the critical challenges of GNN-based recommendation and the potential solutions. Specifically, we start from an extensive background of recommender systems and graph neural networks. Then we fully discuss why GNNs are required in recommender systems and the four parts of challenges, including graph construction, network design, optimization, and computation efficiency. Then, we discuss how to address these challenges by elaborating on the recent advances of GNN-based recommendation models, with a systematic taxonomy from four critical perspectives: stages, scenarios, objectives, and applications. Last, we finalize this tutorial with conclusions and discuss important future directions.},
