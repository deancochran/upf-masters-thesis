\section{LFM1b Recommendation}


\subsection{Preliminary Findings}

To arrive at an inconclusive results section briefly, and unfortunately. The recommendations for graphs that contain more than just users, artists or genres as mentioned above, have not be able to be compiled. This prevents link prediction models from being computed for the user to album or user to track links that exists within the LastFM1b dataset.

As a directly effect of not being able to have a heterogeneous graph with information of tracks or albums, there are no models to predict these edges. Therefore, at the time being, there is only the capability to compute a link prediction model of user to artist edges with a subset of less that 50 users.

The indirect result of this effect prevents any recommendations to be made for users involving tracks or albums. Lastly this prevents the end goal of the thesis to produce a multi target music recommendation list for users utilizing the trained link prediction models.

As a final remark, the algorithm allows can compute recommendations for any given user, and they can be mapped from their unique number id back to the artistâ€™s name, when provided the link prediction model. The link prediction model of just user to artist, while not having recommendation evaluation metrics recorded at this, is able to provide a user listening history, and the top@K recommendations for the given sample edge type and corresponding model.
